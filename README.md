   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python image_editor.py
   ```

### Option 2: Build Executable
Build a standalone executable for distribution:

1. **Activate virtual environment**: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
2. **Install requirements**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. **Build executable**: `python build_cross_platform.py`
4. **Find executable**: In `dist/windows/` or `TIFF_Image_Editor_windows/`

## üìñ **Usage Guide**

### Basic Workflow
1. **Load Image**: Click "Load TIFF" and select your TIFF file (DPI auto-detected)
2. **Enable Navigation**: Click on image to enable mouse wheel zoom and WASD navigation
3. **Select Areas**: Use Clip mode to draw selections around areas of interest
4. **Assign Colors**: Choose colors from picker with opacity control  
5. **Move Sections**: Switch to Move mode, select sections, use gamepad controls or arrow keys
6. **Measure**: Use the ruler tool for precise measurements in centimeters
7. **Export**: Save your edited image with professional measurements

### üéÆ **Navigation Controls**
- **üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out at cursor location
- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Navigate around image (click on image first to enable)
- **Shift + Navigation**: Faster panning/movement  
- **Click Image**: Enable navigation mode (‚úÖ green status)
- **Click UI Elements**: Disable navigation mode (‚ùå red status)

### üéØ **Professional Features**
- **Centimeter Grid**: All measurements in professional cm units
- **Ruler Tool**: Drag to measure distances accurately
- **DPI Detection**: Automatic extraction from TIFF metadata
- **Precision Movement**: Move sections by exact cm values using gamepad controls
- **Section Coordinates**: All positions displayed in centimeters

## üì¶ **Building Executables**

### All Platforms
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Build for current platform
python build_cross_platform.py

# Cross-platform builds (if dependencies available)
python build_cross_platform.py windows
python build_cross_platform.py macos  
python build_cross_platform.py linux
```

**Output**: Standalone executable (~28MB) with all dependencies included

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Setup Issues
- **"Python not found"**: Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add to PATH
- **"venv not working"**: Make sure you're using Python 3.7+ and try `python -m venv .venv`
- **PowerShell execution policy**: Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- **Virtual environment not activating**: Check you're in the project directory and using correct path

### Common Issues
- **"Module not found" errors**: Activate venv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Build fails**: Ensure virtual environment is activated before building
- **Navigation not working**: Click on the image canvas to enable navigation
- **Image won't load**: Ensure file is valid TIFF format with proper metadata
- **Performance issues**: Use "Fit Window" and close other memory-intensive applications

### Professional Tips
- **DPI Accuracy**: TIFF metadata DPI is auto-detected for precise measurements
- **Grid Alignment**: Use 1cm grid spacing for standard professional measurements
- **Section Movement**: Use gamepad controls for precise cm-based positioning
- **Focus Management**: Red ‚ùå = navigation disabled, Green ‚úÖ = navigation enabled
- **Measurement Consistency**: Ruler and grid now use identical cm calculations

## üéØ **Professional Workflow**

### For Technical Documentation
1. **Load TIFF**: High-resolution technical drawings or scanned documents
2. **Set DPI**: Automatic detection ensures accurate cm measurements  
3. **Enable Grid**: 1cm grid with major/minor lines for professional alignment
4. **Measure Components**: Use ruler tool for precise distance measurements
5. **Section Selection**: Select components with accurate boundary detection
6. **Color Coding**: Assign colors to different component types or categories
7. **Export**: Generate professional documentation with measured annotations

### Architecture & Engineering
- **Scale Accuracy**: True-to-scale measurements in centimeters
- **Component Analysis**: Color-code different building elements or systems
- **Dimension Verification**: Cross-check measurements with ruler tool
- **Professional Output**: Clean, measured drawings ready for documentation
