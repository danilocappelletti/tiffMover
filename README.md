## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Setup Issues
- **"Python not found"**: Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add to PATH
- **"venv not working"**: Make sure you're using Python 3.7+ and try `python -m venv .venv`
- **PowerShell execution policy**: Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- **Virtual environment not activating**: Check you're in the project directory and using correct path

### Common Issues
- **"Module not found" errors**: Activate venv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Build fails**: Ensure virtual environment is activated before building
- **Navigation not working**: Click on the image canvas to enable navigation
- **Image won't load**: Ensure file is valid TIFF format with proper metadata
- **Performance issues**: Use "Fit Window" and close other memory-intensive applications

### Professional Tips
- **DPI Accuracy**: TIFF metadata DPI is auto-detected for precise measurements
- **Grid Alignment**: Use 1cm grid spacing for standard professional measurements
- **Section Movement**: Use gamepad controls for precise cm-based positioning
- **Focus Management**: Red ‚ùå = navigation disabled, Green ‚úÖ = navigation enabled
